description: Prep a task before starting implementation
---

Read the main `./CLAUDE.md` file, and then check for a `./claude.task.md` file, and any
context catchup (ledger) files (pattern: `./claude.ledger.*.md`) referenced in the task
file, reading all of them, if they exist, in order.

Summarize your understanding of the task and context in < 20 lines. If something seems
very unclear that would stop you from proceeding, point it out.

If, in the next command, I say something like "start" or "go ahead", or "proceed", then
start with your proposed implementation. If the task documentation specifies phases, be
sure to stop after the first phase.
