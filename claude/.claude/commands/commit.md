description: Create a git commit
---

First, check the repo you're working in for a `git.md` file at any level. If you find one,
read and follow the instructions there.

If you don't, then check if the repo has formatting or lint fixing steps, or if it has a
`just` file, or npm scripts, etc. If there's a check script, run that. Don't commit if you
see problems with that.

If all that looks clear, then sample the last 10 git commit messages just by looking at
the git log with --oneline and see the style of commits that are being made in this
repository.

Beyond that, I pretty much always write in all lowercase for my commit messages, so follow
that convention. I prefer my commit messages to be pretty darn short. Not crazy short, but
just don't be too verbose about them.
