description: Start a task
---

Read the main `./CLAUDE.md` file, and then check for a `./claude.task.md` file, and any
context catchup (ledger) files (pattern: `./claude.ledger.*.md`) referenced in the task
file, reading all of them, if they exist, in order.

Then start on the task right away, unless something is significantly unclear, in which
case ask for clarification.
