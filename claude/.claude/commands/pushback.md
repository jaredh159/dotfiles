description: Push back on the current approach or suggestion
---

I want you to consider what we have been discussing and planning recently.

Now let's analyze it critically. Push back on it. What are we missing? What edge cases are
we not covering? What opportunities did we fail to see?

Think critically. I don't want to go overboard and consider incredibly unlikely edge case
scenarios that aren't worth it, but I do want to take a step back and poke and prod at the
problem a little bit and flush out any blind spots.
