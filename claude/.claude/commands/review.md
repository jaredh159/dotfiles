description: Review current work before proceeding
---

I think we've reached a point where we have a finished chunk of work.

I want you to examine it either with the `git status`, or your context of what we've been
working on, or if it's already been committed by the recent commit/s.

Just probe and consider whether we did everything properly, whether there are
opportunities for improvement to reduce duplication, and important edge cases that we
missed—things like that.
